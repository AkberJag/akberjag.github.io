# 🛠️ Pytest: The Testing Sidekick

Pytest is a **powerful testing framework** for Python. It’s known for its simplicity, scalability, and rich ecosystem of plugins. Here’s why it’s awesome:

- **Concise Syntax**: Write tests with minimal boilerplate.
- **Fixtures**: Reusable setup/teardown code for your tests.
- **Parameterized Tests**: Run the same test with multiple inputs.
- **Rich Assertions**: Get detailed feedback when tests fail.

## Installing Pytest with UV

To install `pytest` using `uv`, run the following command:

```bash
uv add --dev pytest
```

This adds `pytest` as a development dependency in your project.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

There’s no one-size-fits-all project structure, but here are two common approaches:

### 1. **Mirror the Project Directory (Smaller Projects)**

For smaller projects, you can mirror your project directory structure in the `tests` folder. This keeps things simple and easy to navigate.

```
superhero_api/
├── src/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── routes/
│   └── database.py
├── tests/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── routes/
|   ├── conftest.py
│   └── pytest.ini
└── main.py
```

### 2. **Organize by Test Type (Larger Projects)**

For larger projects, you might want to organize tests by type (unit, integration, e2e) within each folder. This makes it easier to manage and run specific types of tests.

```
superhero_api/
├── src/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── routes/
│   └── database.py
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── routes/
│   ├── integration/
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── routes/
│   ├── e2e/
│   │   └── workflows/
│   ├── conftest.py
│   └── pytest.ini
├── requirements.txt
└── main.py
```

**Remember**: There’s no fixed way to structure your tests. Choose what works best for your project and team.
